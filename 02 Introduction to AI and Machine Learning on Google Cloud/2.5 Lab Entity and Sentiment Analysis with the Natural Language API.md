First, we create an API key. I won't show it here for obvious reasons

Next, we connect to a Linux VM instance

And we can interact with it via SSH. I have already posted the following JSON into request.json using the nano text editor:

```json
{
  "document":{
    "type":"PLAIN_TEXT",
    "content":"Joanne Rowling, who writes under the pen names J. K. Rowling and Robert Galbraith, is a British novelist and screenwriter who wrote the Harry Potter fantasy series."
  },
  "encodingType":"UTF8"
}
```
