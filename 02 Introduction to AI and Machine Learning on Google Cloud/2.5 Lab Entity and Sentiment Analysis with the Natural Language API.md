## 1. Natural language API

First, we create an API key. I won't show it here for obvious reasons

Next, we connect to a Linux VM instance

And we can interact with it via SSH. I have already posted the following JSON into request.json using the nano text editor:

```json
{
  "document":{
    "type":"PLAIN_TEXT",
    "content":"Joanne Rowling, who writes under the pen names J. K. Rowling and Robert Galbraith, is a British novelist and screenwriter who wrote the Harry Potter fantasy series."
  },
  "encodingType":"UTF8"
}
```

In the same CLI, I can pass in this `curl` command:

```curl
curl "https://language.googleapis.com/v1/documents:analyzeEntities?key=${API_KEY}" \
  -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data-binary @request.json > result.json
```
And verifying using `cat results.json`:

It worked. My API key was stored in the `requests.json` document.

## 2. Sentiment analysis

We can test sentiment analysis on an example sentence. The lab gave this text snippet, which clearly has a very positive sentiment:

```json
 {
  "document":{
    "type":"PLAIN_TEXT",
    "content":"Harry Potter is the best book. I think everyone should read it."
  },
  "encodingType": "UTF8"
}
```

I'll update the request file using `nano request.json` and paste in this content:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76b21278-3b00-46a9-b7a1-9da833cdd3de)

And now we can use a `curl` command to execute the sentiment analysis:

```curl
curl "https://language.googleapis.com/v1/documents:analyzeSentiment?key=${API_KEY}" \
  -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data-binary @request.json
```

The results:

```=${API_KEY}" \
  -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data-binary @request.json
{
  "documentSentiment": {
    "magnitude": 1.9,
    "score": 0.9
  },
  "language": "en",
  "sentences": [
    {
      "text": {
        "content": "Harry Potter is the best book.",
        "beginOffset": 0
      },
      "sentiment": {
        "magnitude": 0.9,
        "score": 0.9
      }
    },
    {
      "text": {
        "content": "I think everyone should read it.",
        "beginOffset": 31
      },
      "sentiment": {
        "magnitude": 0.9,
        "score": 0.9
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

We can see that each of the two sentences were broken into a token. Each token has a very high sentiment score (0.9), with magnitudes of 0.9.

### Explaination of the values:

Via the lab:
`score - is a number from -1.0 to 1.0 indicating how positive or negative the statement is.
magnitude - is a number ranging from 0 to infinity that represents the weight of sentiment expressed in the statement, regardless of being positive or negative.`

## Analyzing entity sentiment

We can break down the sentiment of different aspects of a sentence using entity sentiment analysis. For instance, in the sentence, "I liked the sushi but the service was terrible.", the sentiment between the two entities, `sushi` and `service` is clearly very different.

```json
 {
  "document":{
    "type":"PLAIN_TEXT",
    "content":"I liked the sushi but the service was terrible."
  },
  "encodingType": "UTF8"
}
```

The results:

```json
{
  "entities": [
    {
      "name": "sushi",
      "type": "CONSUMER_GOOD",
      "metadata": {},
      "salience": 0.51064336,
      "mentions": [
        {
          "text": {
            "content": "sushi",
            "beginOffset": 12
          },
          "type": "COMMON",
          "sentiment": {
            "magnitude": 0,
            "score": 0
          }
        }
      ],
      "sentiment": {
        "magnitude": 0,
        "score": 0
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "service",
      "type": "OTHER",
      "metadata": {},
      "salience": 0.48935664,
      "mentions": [
        {
          "text": {
            "content": "service",
            "beginOffset": 26
          },
          "type": "COMMON",
          "sentiment": {
            "magnitude": 0.7,
            "score": -0.7
          }
        }
      ],
      "sentiment": {
        "magnitude": 0.7,
        "score": -0.7
      }
    }
  ],
  "language": "en"
}
```

This worked as the lab expected, but not as I would expect - `service` has a sentiment of -0.7, which makes sense, but `sushi` surprisingly has a score of 0.0. This is consistent with the expected results in the lab though.
