### 1. Natural language API

First, we create an API key. I won't show it here for obvious reasons

Next, we connect to a Linux VM instance

And we can interact with it via SSH. I have already posted the following JSON into request.json using the nano text editor:

```json
{
  "document":{
    "type":"PLAIN_TEXT",
    "content":"Joanne Rowling, who writes under the pen names J. K. Rowling and Robert Galbraith, is a British novelist and screenwriter who wrote the Harry Potter fantasy series."
  },
  "encodingType":"UTF8"
}
```

In the same CLI, I can pass in this `curl` command:

```curl
curl "https://language.googleapis.com/v1/documents:analyzeEntities?key=${API_KEY}" \
  -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data-binary @request.json > result.json
```
And verifying using `cat results.json`:

It worked. My API key was stored in the `requests.json` document.

### 2. Sentiment analysis

We can test sentiment analysis on an example sentence. The lab gave this text snippet, which clearly has a very positive sentiment:

```json
 {
  "document":{
    "type":"PLAIN_TEXT",
    "content":"Harry Potter is the best book. I think everyone should read it."
  },
  "encodingType": "UTF8"
}
```

I'll update the request file using `nano request.json` and paste in this content:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76b21278-3b00-46a9-b7a1-9da833cdd3de)

And now we can use a `curl` command to execute the sentiment analysis:

```curl
curl "https://language.googleapis.com/v1/documents:analyzeSentiment?key=${API_KEY}" \
  -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data-binary @request.json
```

The results:

```=${API_KEY}" \
  -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data-binary @request.json
{
  "documentSentiment": {
    "magnitude": 1.9,
    "score": 0.9
  },
  "language": "en",
  "sentences": [
    {
      "text": {
        "content": "Harry Potter is the best book.",
        "beginOffset": 0
      },
      "sentiment": {
        "magnitude": 0.9,
        "score": 0.9
      }
    },
    {
      "text": {
        "content": "I think everyone should read it.",
        "beginOffset": 31
      },
      "sentiment": {
        "magnitude": 0.9,
        "score": 0.9
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

We can see that each of the two sentences were broken into a token. Each token has a very high sentiment score (0.9), with magnitudes of 0.9.
